# Sync and storage

How RA data gets onto the SD card and stays fresh: the caches (`core/storage/`), the sync engine
(`core/sync/`) and the threads around them.

## Storage

**Rule: user data lives in plain files; every database is a disposable cache.** Nothing a user
entered or chose is stored in SQLite. Every database can be deleted at any moment; the app
then recreates it and re-syncs. There are no schema migrations: when a cache's
`schema_version` doesn't match the code (an app update), or the file is unreadable or corrupt,
the app deletes it and starts fresh.

| What | Where | Kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| API key | `Saves/cheevos/apikey.txt` | User data | Plain text, user-editable |
| Settings | `Saves/cheevos/settings.json` | User data | JSON, written atomically (temp file + rename). Unknown keys are ignored and invalid values fall back to defaults. |
| PyUI view state | `Saves/cheevos/pyui-state.json` | Cache | PyUI's last selections, kept apart from the launcher's own state. |
| RA data cache | `Saves/cheevos/cache/data.db` | Cache | SQLite: profile, games, achievements, awards, sync state. Rebuildable from RA. |
| Image cache | `Saves/cheevos/cache/media.db` | Cache | SQLite blobs keyed `badge/<BadgeName>[_lock]`, `icon/<gameId>`, `avatar/<user>`. Kept separate so "Clear image cache" doesn't drop RA data. |
| Image scratch | `/tmp/cheevos/media/` | Cache | The images the current screen needs, extracted from `media.db` because PyUI loads images by path (~17 ms per 40 badges). tmpfs is RAM, so it's bounded: 4 MB, LRU, counted in whole 4 KB pages (a 3 KB badge takes a page). |
| Drawing scratch | `/tmp/cheevos/scaled/` | Cache | Generated PNGs (swatches, button glyphs), and in `sharp/` the enlarged screenshots: only the newest 4 (up to 1.4 MB each). |
| Log | `Saves/spruce/cheevos-$PLATFORM.log` | — | Spruce's convention. Rotating, 1 MB × 2. |

- `Saves/` survives Spruce updates and app reinstalls, so the cache lives there too and an
  update doesn't trigger a full resync. `Saves/cheevos/cache/` can be wiped freely.
- Both databases use `journal_mode=DELETE` and `synchronous=NORMAL`. Writes are short
  transactions on the sync thread.
- The pending proxy queue is **not** copied into our cache. We read it live
  ([integration.md](integration.md)), so it can never go stale or out of step with the proxy.

**Schema sketch for `data.db`** (`core/storage/schema.py`, versioned through
`PRAGMA user_version`; a mismatch means recreate):

```sql
meta(key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT)  -- username, last sync, unfinished full download,
                                        -- RA's pause, unlock window, first hardcore unlock, recent unlock feed
profile(username TEXT PRIMARY KEY, json TEXT, synced_at INTEGER)
games(game_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, title, console_id, console_name, image_icon,
      max_possible, num_awarded, num_awarded_hc, most_recent_awarded_at, highest_award_kind,
      highest_award_at, last_played_at, detail_synced_at, detail_fingerprint)
achievements(achievement_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, game_id, title, description, points,
      true_ratio, badge_name, display_order, type, num_awarded, num_awarded_hc,
      earned_at, earned_hc_at)
game_stats(game_id PRIMARY KEY, num_distinct_players, num_players_casual, num_players_hc)
awards(game_id, kind, title, console_id, console_name, image_icon, awarded_at, display_order,
       PRIMARY KEY(game_id, kind))
```

The recent-unlock feed is a versioned JSON snapshot in `meta.recent_unlock_feed`, bounded to
100 entries with their achievement definitions and game metadata. It is replaced in one
transaction only after complete history coverage; failure or cancellation preserves the old
feed. Feed rows never mark a full game set as downloaded. No SQL schema bump is needed, so
existing game and image caches survive this update. Before the first snapshot, Recent unlocks
falls back to the old cached achievement sets for offline compatibility.

The profile's recent-points window (`API_GetAchievementsEarnedBetween`) is stored too, for
offline use. If the configured username differs from `meta.username`, the cache is for another
account and is recreated.

## The device constraints behind this
- **SD card:** FAT32 with 32 KB clusters, mounted `dirsync`. Many small files are slow and waste
  space: 200 badges as files took 0.70 s and 6.3 MB of disk on the Mini, as SQLite blobs 0.12 s
  and 832 KB. Hence images as blobs in `media.db`.
- **SQLite:** WAL needs shared memory and is unreliable on FAT32, so all databases use
  `journal_mode=DELETE`. A `kill -9` during a full re-sync leaves `PRAGMA integrity_check` ok and
  no journal file; the next sync carries on (`full_resync_since`).
- **Blob scans:** a badge spills into overflow pages, and a column stored after a blob is read
  by walking them. So a scan of `media` reads the whole file, even for `SUM(size)`: 2.4 s for
  48 MB on the Mini. Settings shows the size of `media.db` (`os.stat`, 0.1 ms) instead.
- **`/tmp`:** a 49 MB tmpfs, which is RAM. Keep extracted images bounded; the app deletes both
  scratch folders on exit.
- **Clock:** there may be no RTC, so the device can boot in 1970. TLS failures automatically
  retry over HTTP. `core/clock.py` shares RA's API `Date` plus monotonic elapsed time across
  sync, game downloads and UI calculations. Before the first valid sample it uses system time.
  Ignore malformed dates and media CDN dates. Never change the system clock or Spruce's time
  settings. NTP isn't a prerequisite for Cheevos.

## Sync engine
It runs on a background worker thread. The UI reads committed DB state and a thread-safe
`SyncProgress` snapshot.

1. **Pre-flight**:
   - Connectivity: `HEAD https://retroachievements.org` with a 3 s timeout and the transport's
     HTTP fallback on TLS failure. This refreshes app time before checking a stored pause.
   - Rate limit: if RA asked for a long pause (`meta.rate_limited_until`) and the time isn't up,
     stop with "RetroAchievements asked to wait N min" without a Web API request. The
     credential-free HEAD may run to refresh time. A finished sync
     clears it.
2. **Profile**: `GetUserSummary` (`g=1` for the last game).
3. **Game list**: every page of `GetUserCompletionProgress`. Upsert the `games` rows. Compute a
   fingerprint per game: `(MaxPossible, NumAwarded, NumAwardedHardcore, MostRecentAwardedDate,
   HighestAwardKind)`.
4. **Awards**: `GetUserAwards`. One request, before the details, so the awards wall and the
   home screen are complete as early as the games list.
5. **Recent unlocks**: `GetAchievementsEarnedBetween`, latest 100 distinct achievements. Query
   backwards from the latest `MostRecentAwardedDate` to the account's member date: neither
   bound depends on the device clock. Start with 7 days, halve any capped (500-row) window
   before accepting it, and expand uncapped windows while fewer than 100 entries are found.
   Windows are inclusive and disjoint. Small accounts whose history fits below the cap use
   one whole-history request. Keep the newest event per achievement; hardcore wins a
   same-second duplicate. A capped single second or exhausted request budget fails without
   publishing a partial snapshot. Reuse a snapshot while the unlock-bearing library
   fingerprints match, for up to 30 days. Ordinary play activity alone does not refresh it.
6. **Plan detail fetches.** A game's details take one request, spaced 3 s apart at the steady
   pace, so a sync doesn't fetch every game: 2,937 games would take about 2.5 hours. It keeps a
   **working set**: games on this device (`local_games`) and games played or unlocked within the "Recent
   games" window (30 days by default). Other games are fetched when opened (the game worker,
   below). Planned:
   - never fetched, for a game in the working set;
   - the fingerprint changed, for any cached game;
   - the details are older than 30 days, for any cached game. At most 20 of these per sync,
     oldest first, so revised sets slowly converge;
   - every game, while "Download every game" is unfinished (`meta.full_resync_since`). It
     resumes in every later sync until a sync finishes, unless the user stops it in Settings.
7. **Fetch details**: `GetGameInfoAndUserProgress` per planned game, committed **one game at a
   time**. An interrupted sync (power-off, sleep, app exit) resumes from the remaining plan on the
   next run.
   - The test account (2,937 games) has 60 games in a 30-day working set: about 3 minutes
     for its details at the current pace, plus media downloads spaced 0.25 s apart.
8. **Badges** (the "Badge downloads" setting):
   - On-device + recent: games in `local_games` plus games played or unlocked within the recent
     window.
   - All: every game whose details are cached.
   - Both scopes also include colour badges for the recent feed, independently of game sets.
   - None: nothing is downloaded during sync.
   - Only the variant matching the current state is fetched: colour if unlocked, `_lock` if
     locked. This halves the file count. A newly unlocked achievement gets its colour badge on the
     next sync. In every mode, missing images are fetched lazily while browsing online
     (`lazy_media.py`).
   - The `_lock` blob stays after an unlock, on purpose: it's a few KB, it's needed again if
     progress is reset on RA, and "Clear image cache" removes it.
9. **Local matching refresh** ([integration.md](integration.md), "On-device games").

- **Triggers**: auto on app open when the network is up and the setting is on; Start on any
  screen; Settings → "Sync now" / "Download every game".
- **Cancellation**: sync stops at the next safe point when Start is pressed again or the app
  exits. A wait for the next request slot or a retry ends at once (the client raises
  `RequestCancelledError`).
- **Progress**: fixed planned game totals, shown compactly as `Games 3/12` (the active
  game's ordinal). History coverage has no known request total: show the phase and entries
  found. The UI displays no ETA; the tracker's existing estimates remain internal.

`python -m cheevos.core.sync` runs a sync without the UI ([TESTING.md](../TESTING.md)).

## Threads
- **UI thread**: PyUI and SDL only.
- **Sync thread**: network and DB writes.
- **Image worker**: one thread fetching images needed on screen (`LazyMediaFetcher`), with its
  own cache connection. Not a FIFO: an image for the screen goes ahead of everything waiting
  (in draw order), asking again moves a waiting image up, the next page's images wait at the
  back, and when the visible rows change the UI drops whatever is still waiting
  (`MediaResolver.new_window`). So a jump to the end of a long list waits for its own screen
  only ([pyui.md](pyui.md), "Downloads follow the visible rows").
- **Game worker**: one thread fetching the achievements of a game the user opens when they
  aren't cached (`DetailFetcher`, `core/sync/detail_fetch.py`), with its own client and cache
  connection. The latest request goes first. It refreshes app time when checking RA's stored
  pause, stores a long pause for the sync to respect, and reopens its client after a key
  rejection. The game screen shows "Loading achievements…" and polls it every input tick; B
  backs out and the fetch still completes. A game it fetched after the sync planned the same
  game isn't fetched again by the sync. A Recent unlock card already has its definition:
  it draws immediately, requests missing game statistics on this worker and enriches itself
  on input ticks. Rarity stays unknown offline until the game details are cached.
- **SQLite**: one connection per thread. Writes happen on the sync thread and the game worker,
  one short transaction per game (the 5 s busy timeout covers the other's writes), plus small
  `meta` writes from the UI (the unlock window, stopping "Download every game"). The UI never
  waits on the network, except for "See more", behind a Loading page.
- **Noticing changes:** `DataCache.version()` changes after any write to `data.db`: SQLite's
  `PRAGMA data_version` for other connections, plus the UI connection's own `total_changes`.
  It reads no table, so the games list checks it on every visit and reads the games again only
  when it changed.
- **Request pacing**: every thread that calls the Web API takes its slots from the app's one
  `Pacer`, so together they stay within a short burst, then one request every 3 s
  ([retroachievements.md](retroachievements.md), "Politeness").
