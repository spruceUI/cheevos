# PyUI: the bridge, drawing and themes

PyUI is SpruceOS's Python/SDL2 UI toolkit. Cheevos imports it at runtime from
`/mnt/SDCARD/App/PyUI/main-ui` and never vendors it (Spruce is CC BY-NC, and PyUI changes
weekly). Only `cheevos.ui.pyui` (the bridge) and `cheevos.platform.desktop` (dev shim) may import
it ([code.md](code.md), "Layers"). Read this file before touching either.

Both early questions have a yes: PyUI can be started from a separate app (`app/launch.sh` mirrors
the platform branch of PyUI's own launcher; about 3 s to a usable screen on the Mini), and its
views draw what the app needs (lists with icons and right-aligned values, badge grids, popups,
custom screens). Progress bars, frames and the bottom-bar status are drawn by the bridge on top
of PyUI's views, without patching PyUI.

## The bridge
- **Bootstrap**: mirror `mainui.py` start-up:
  1. `PyUiConfig.init`, `UserConfig.reload_config`, `CfwSystemConfig.init`, `Language.init`;
  2. `initialize_device(<name>, main_ui_mode=False)`, `PyUiState.init`;
  3. `Theme.init`, `Display.init`, `Controller.init`.
- **Device name**: the same `-device` value PyUI's `launch.sh` would pass, e.g.
  `MIYOO_MINI_PLUS`. `app/launch.sh` gets it from Spruce (`get_miyoo_mini_variant` on the Mini
  family) and passes `CHEEVOS_PYUI_DEVICE`; the bridge creates the device with PyUI's own
  `mainui.initialize_device(..., main_ui_mode=False)` (the mode Spruce's `-msgDisplay` helpers
  use), so every Spruce device works without copying PyUI's device table. Importing `mainui`
  doesn't start PyUI.
- **Standard views** (`ViewCreator.create_view`): lists (`ICON_AND_DESC`, `TEXT_AND_IMAGE`) and
  grids (`GRID`), through `views.choose()`, or a `views.PreparedView` that a screen keeps to
  show again ("Showing a view again", below).
- **Custom screens** (profile, achievement card, full-screen screenshot) are drawn with PyUI's
  `Display` primitives and `Theme` colours and fonts (`primitives.py`), so they still follow the
  theme.
- **Keyboard**: `display/on_screen_keyboard.OnScreenKeyboard`. Its text field is the theme's
  list highlight (`bg-list-l`, 640x90 in SPRUCE) drawn a sixteenth of the screen width tall at
  its natural aspect: 44% of the width, so a 32-character key ran past it. While the keyboard
  is open, `ask_text` swaps `Theme.keyboard_entry_bg` for a 16:1 swatch in the field's colour,
  which scales to the full width (every tested theme's highlight is a flat colour). Its
  background (`bg-grid-s`) is transparent in SPRUCE and missing in the other tested themes, so
  the bottom bar drawn by `Display.clear` stays visible and carries the keyboard's hints.
- The bridge exposes typed functions. Screens never touch PyUI objects directly.
- **Typing:** PyUI has no type hints and its ABCs confuse ty (`get_input(timeout)` declared
  without `self`, `pass` bodies inferring `None` returns). `pyproject.toml` treats PyUI as `Any`
  (`replace-imports-with-any`); the bridge keeps any `Any` inside and screens see only our types.
- **Version drift:** `pyui-tested-commit` (under `[tool.cheevos]` in `pyproject.toml`) records
  the SpruceOS commit the bridge was last verified against; `make pyui` checks it out into
  `.spruceos/`. The weekly `pyui-drift` workflow tests the latest `Development`. Bump the commit
  after re-verifying against a newer SpruceOS.

## Start-up gotchas
- **Import path:** PyUI must sit at `sys.path[0]`; `Language` finds `lang/` relative to it
  (`bootstrap.add_pyui_to_path`).
- **Logging:** never call `PyUiLogger.init`. It replaces stdout/stderr. Inject our logger into
  `PyUiLogger._logger` instead (`bootstrap.install_logger`). Skip
  `Theme.convert_theme_if_needed` (PyUI already did it at its own start-up).
- **Device object:** any device object must give the top bar real battery and charge numbers: a
  stub returning `None` crashes it.
- **Configs:** PyUI's and Spruce's configs are read, never written. PyUI's view state goes to
  our own `Saves/cheevos/pyui-state.json`. `UserConfig.FILEPATH` is hard-coded to the SD card,
  so the desktop bootstrap overrides it.
- **Timezone:** call `device.restore_saved_timezone()` after creating the device, or every
  clock shows UTC. PyUI's launcher does this; we must too.
- **Screensaver:** in non-launcher mode (`main_ui_mode=False`) the Mini lacks
  `miyoo_mini_flip_shared_memory_writer`, so the screensaver can't dim the backlight. The
  bridge creates it (`bootstrap._enable_backlight_control`).
- **Fullscreen window:** PyUI opens a fullscreen window at the monitor's size. On the desktop,
  `window.windowed()` swaps `sdl2.ext.Window` while the display starts.

## View gotchas
- **Timeouts:** `view.get_selection()` never returns `None`. On a timeout or cursor move it
  returns a `Selection` whose input is `None`. That is our tick for live refreshes (sync
  progress).
- **Popups:** a `POPUP` view freezes the current frame as its backdrop
  (`Display.lock_current_image`) until `view_finished()` is called. Forget it and every later
  screen is drawn over the frozen frame. `PreparedView.show()` (and so `choose()`) always calls
  it.
- **Showing a view again:** preparing a big list is the slow part (2,940 games: 0.9 s on a Mini),
  so the games list keeps its `PreparedView` and shows it again, back from a game (60 ms). PyUI's
  list keeps its selection and scroll position, and `view_finished()` does nothing for lists and
  grids. Before each later show, the bridge sets the title again (the top bar forgets an award
  dot once another title is drawn) and `VisibleImages.resume()` asks for the visible rows' images
  again (the screens in between moved the downloads to their rows). A popup can be shown once:
  its backdrop is released when it ends.
- **Lazy icons:** `icon_searcher` is called on every render, which is good for lazy images.
  `image_path_searcher` is cached after the first call. But `ViewCreator.create_view` also calls
  every row's `get_icon()` for an `ICON_AND_DESC` list (to pick the selection background), so
  opening a 138-row list used to queue all 138 badge downloads, top to bottom, and a jump to the
  end waited for all of them. `PreparedView` marks that scan `ImageDemand.MEASURED`: the
  resolver returns the fallback icon without downloading or even looking in the cache (first
  thing, and from a dict: building a `Path` per row cost 0.2 s for 2,940 rows). Returning cached
  images extracted every row's icon: with 1,012 cached game icons that pushed ~20 MB through
  the 4 MB scratch LRU (851 evictions) and made the view 10× slower to build. Grids ask
  `image_path_selected_searcher` for the highlighted tile; leave it unset and the selected
  tile has no image.
- **Grids need an image size:** without `grid_resized_width/height`, `GridView.__init__` resolves
  and loads every tile's image to find the tallest. With 2,000 awards that took half a second on
  a Mac. It also extracted hundreds of images through the 4 MB scratch LRU, which evicted files
  whose paths PyUI had already cached; loading those failed, and PyUI blacklisted them for the
  session. `PreparedView` always passes a tile size.
- **Grid shape** (`views.grid_shape`): PyUI's `GridView` splits the screen into the `cols`×`rows`
  we pass. Tiles and columns scale like the theme's list rows (155 px columns at 640x480, a
  quarter narrower allowed). Rows are as tall as `GridView._render_cell` needs: the image moved
  by `gridMultiRowImageYOffset`, then a caption one line up from the row's bottom, moved by
  `multiRowGridTextYOffset`. SPRUCE's 480x800 config moves both, so a fixed row height put
  captions on the badges there. Result: 4x2 on 4:3 and 3:2 screens, 5x2 at 1280x720, 4x3
  (badges) at 720x720, 3x3 at 480x800.
- **Grid tiles cache their image path:** `GridOrListEntry` drops its searchers after one call.
  `visible_images.VisibleImages` re-arms the visible tiles' searchers when `MediaResolver.version` changes,
  so lazily downloaded icons appear. List rows use `icon_searcher`, which PyUI calls every frame.
- **Downloads follow the visible rows:** `visible_images.VisibleImages` wraps each list's and grid's `_render`.
  When the window (`current_top/bottom`, `current_left/right`) moves, it drops the downloads
  still waiting, asks the visible rows again (front of the queue) and queues one more screenful
  in the scroll direction (`ImageDemand.NEXT`, back of the queue). Sizes come from the view, so
  they scale with the screen (5 rows at 640x480, 9 at 480x800).
- **Grid overlays:** `GridView._render` ends with `present()`, so anything drawn after it is
  lost. Wrap the per-tile `_render_cell` instead (`grid_frames.py`); PyUI calls it with keyword
  arguments (`visible_index=`, `imageTextPair=`).
- **Row bars:** progress bars in list rows wrap one view's `_render` (`row_bars.py`) and
  replicate `DescriptiveListView._render`'s geometry (icon column = 1/8 of the selected-row
  background, description at `text_offset_y + title height`). An item with `progress` gets an
  empty (not `None`) description, so PyUI keeps the two-line layout. Colours:
  `bar_colors.py`, after RA's website ([retroachievements.md](retroachievements.md)).
  Every bar has the same length; larger award circles overlay its right endpoint.
  `award_images.py` selects bundled PNGs from `res/awards/`, baked on the development machine
  by `scripts/render_awards.py`. The Games list does no circle rasterization or award PNG writes.
  Dark/light assets follow each row's background; black/white assets handle contrast fallback.
  Each source circle is 48 px across (50 px canvas, or 116 px including the mastery halo),
  scaled with the theme's description line height. For hollow rings, an opaque swatch in the
  row's average background colour covers only the strip of bar inside the ring, ending at
  the circle centre; the rim hides the strip's left edge. The top bar uses these same PNGs
  at a smaller size, including mastery glow, with no bar to mask inside hollow rings.
- **Long text:** PyUI does not truncate list titles against `value_text`, or descriptions at
  the screen edge. The bridge fits both (`ui/pyui/text.py`).

## Drawing gotchas
- **Texture caches never evict:** `Display` caches a texture per distinct string and per image
  path forever. When an allocation fails, it flushes both and retries ("Clearing cache : Out of
  memory" in the log). On the Mini that happened every half minute of browsing long lists, and
  a big screenshot texture could fail to load. `texture_budget.py` swaps each cache's dict for
  an LRU of 2.5 screens' worth of pixels (3 MB each at 640×480), installed after
  `Display.init`. Text that changes every frame (sync progress) is still drawn with
  `alpha=255`, which skips the cache entirely.
- **PyUI logs text it can't draw:** `Display.render_text` logs the string on SDL errors ("SDL
  Error received on loading <text>"), which do happen when memory runs low. Don't put secrets
  on screen without muting its log (`ask_text(..., secret=True)`).
- **Measurement cost:** measuring text with SDL_ttf for every row is very slow on a Mini
  (1,000 rows took more than 15 s). Use cached glyph advances (`text.text_width`): one dict per
  font, summed with `sum(map(...))`. A cached call per character (`lru_cache`, an Enum's
  `.value`) cost several times more. `displayable()` returns plain ASCII at once and looks up
  any other character once per font: every description has a "·".
- **Row height:** PyUI's own `_calculate_line_height` sizes every row's title and description
  with SDL_ttf to find the tallest (0.66 s for 2,940 rows). `views._one_sample_row` has it
  measure one sample row instead, holding every character the rows use; our rows share one
  layout, so it comes out the same (checked in SPRUCE, MINIMAL, ART_BOOK_NEXT and Pico-8 at
  640x480, 480x800 and 1280x720).
- **Image measurement:** `Display.get_image_dimensions` loads the file every call. Cache widths.
- **Fonts:** theme fonts vary. Pico-8 has no "·" or "…" and no accented letters, and no theme has
  emoji. Every string goes through `text.displayable(value, role)`, which checks glyphs with
  `TTF_GlyphIsProvided32` and falls back to ASCII (accents: the NFKD base letter).
- **Image scaling:** PyUI scales images with linear filtering, which blurs pixel art.
  `primitives.sharp_scaled` enlarges by the next whole factor above the fit with
  nearest-neighbour (BMP in the RAM scratch), then PyUI shrinks it into the box: "sharp
  bilinear", crisp and using the whole box (a GBA shot on 640×480: 3× = 720×480, drawn
  640×427). An exact whole-factor fit is drawn 1:1.
- **No bars:** PyUI always draws the theme's top and bottom bars; full-screen images paint
  black over them (`begin_bare`). A theme with `renderTopAndBottomBarLast` would draw them on
  top again; none of the themes tested does (SPRUCE, MINIMAL, ART_BOOK_NEXT, Pico-8).
- **Translucent fills don't work on the Mini:** its SDL renderer (MMIYOO) ignores
  `SDL_SetRenderDrawBlendMode` for `SDL_RenderFillRect`, so a 60-alpha fill draws opaque. It
  blends textures fine. Draw translucent rectangles as a stretched translucent PNG
  (`generated.swatch`, `ResizeType.ZOOM`). ZOOM crops the source to the target's shape, so the
  swatch must match the strip's orientation (256×16 wide, 16×256 tall), or a thin side rounds
  to 0 px and nothing is drawn. The desktop can't show this; check on a device.
- **Generated images:** `generated.py` writes PNGs (swatches and button glyphs) with a
  stdlib encoder into the RAM scratch: SDL_image can't always save PNG on devices.
- **Bottom bar hook:** the sync status wraps `Display.bottom_bar.render_bottom_bar` (an instance
  attribute), not `Display.clear`. Themes with `renderTopAndBottomBarLast` draw the bar in
  `present()`, after the content. The hook (`status_bar.py`) skips frames where PyUI shows its
  own bar text, and frames under a popup (`Display.bg_canvas` set): the frozen backdrop already
  holds the status, and redrawing changed text over it would smear on translucent bars (SPRUCE,
  Pico-8). `status_bar.hidden()` (the keyboard) drops the status and the Start action but keeps
  hints. `app.run` installs the bar before setup too (no status, Start does nothing), so setup
  screens can show hints.
- **Top-bar title** (`title_bar.py`): PyUI draws the title centred at `int(width / 2)`. A game's
  `Title` shortens only its name, so the count stays. For the award dot, the bridge passes PyUI
  the whole title with a run of spaces in it, and a hook on `Display.top_bar.render_top_bar`
  draws a smaller bundled award PNG in the gap (measured once with SDL_ttf, including room for
  the halo). Its path and size are kept with the title. If the hook draws nothing, the title
  still reads right. Gotchas:
  - `displayable()` collapses runs of spaces, so the gap is added after fitting the name.
  - Unlike the bottom bar, PyUI redraws the whole top bar on popup frames, over the frozen
    backdrop; the dot is drawn there too.
  - The dot belongs to one exact title string and is forgotten the first time the top bar
    draws any other title, so no screen gets a stale one. Themes that show tabs
    (`skip_main_menu`, ART_BOOK_NEXT) or hide the title get no dot.

## Themes
- **Size and DPI:** nothing in Spruce or PyUI knows a panel's DPI or physical size. PyUI draws at
  the device's logical resolution: the panel's own, except the Miniloong Pocket 1 (960x720
  scaled 1.5x to a denser panel). Themes do the sizing: SPRUCE ships `config_<WxH>.json` and
  `skin_<WxH>/` per resolution, scaled from the 640x480 design by `min(width/640, height/480)`
  (PyUI's `Theme._default_multiplier`). List rows are 18.8% of the height on every landscape
  screen, so each shows 5 rows, just sharper; 720x720 shows 7 and 480x800 (drawn at 640x480
  size) 9. Follow the theme rather than the pixel count: size things from its measurements
  (row height, fonts, offsets), and add items only where the screen has room left, never by
  shrinking them, or a sharper small screen gets unreadable.
- **Top-bar title:** PyUI centres it between the clock (left) and the battery and Wi-Fi icons
  (stacked from the right edge). Those have fixed pixel widths, so a fixed share of the screen
  ran into the clock at 480x800. `text.fit_title` measures them once (`_title_room`, mirroring
  `TopBar.render_top_bar_menu_not_skipped`) and falls back to 44% of the width.
- **Bottom bar:** every theme tested (SPRUCE, MINIMAL, ART_BOOK_NEXT, Pico-8) keeps PyUI's bottom
  bar on (a 60 px strip at 640×480). SPRUCE hides the A/B hints with 640 px transparent icons,
  so the sync status is centred; MINIMAL, ART_BOOK_NEXT and Pico-8 show "A Okay / B Back", so it
  starts after them. A theme with `showBottomBar: false` gets no status at all.
- **Button icons:** SPRUCE and MINIMAL ship `icon-x.png` and `icon-y.png` (26×26) and
  `icon-START.png` (48×26 "START" badge). There is no Select icon, and SPRUCE's A/B icons are
  640 px-wide transparent images. `glyphs.py` generates missing ones from the START badge's
  colours, height and the theme font (bold).
- **Layout differences:** some themes replace the top bar (ART_BOOK_NEXT shows tabs instead
  of our title), and some have line metrics that make PyUI's own rows overlap (Pico-8). Both
  are theme or PyUI behaviour, not ours.
- **Testing other themes on the desktop:** copy them from the device into `dev/themes/`, then
  set `CHEEVOS_THEMES_DIR` ([TESTING.md](../TESTING.md)).

## Buttons
In PyUI's game lists (`menus/games/roms_menu_common.py`):
- **A** launches.
- **X** opens the game's context menu (`GameConfigMenu`).
- **Select** toggles list/grid.
- **Menu** opens the options popup.
- **L1/R1** page.

**Start** is unused in lists. Elsewhere in Spruce, X is always per-item (Bluetooth: forget
device; themes: theme options) and Start means "confirm" (on-screen keyboard, RAOfflineProxy's
menu). Our mapping (the full table is in [product.md](product.md), "Controls"):
- **Start**: sync / cancel, on every screen. `choose()` and `wait_for()` route it to
  `status_bar.press_start()`; popups and the keyboard (`ask_text` hides the status) don't.
- **Y**: filter/sort/view popup.
- **X**: contextual: reveal a hidden description, "See more" on the profile. That fits PyUI's
  per-item convention.
- **Select**: switch the view (games: bars/details; a game's achievements: list/grid).
