# RetroAchievements: API, client and the website's rules

Everything Cheevos knows about RetroAchievements (RA) comes from its public Web API, and the
look and counting rules come from the website's own source (RAWeb). The client lives in
`core/ra_client/`; profile numbers in `core/stats.py`.

## The client
- **Web API** only: `https://retroachievements.org/API/API_*.php?y=<key>&u=<user>&...`.
  We never call the Connect API (`dorequest.php`); that belongs to emulators and the proxy.
- **Endpoints**:

  | Endpoint | Used for |
  |---|---|
  | `API_GetUserProfile` | Key validation, profile basics |
  | `API_GetUserSummary` (`g=1&a=10`) | Rank, TotalRanked, last game and rich presence |
  | `API_GetUserCompletionProgress` (`c=500&o=`) | Game list and change detection |
  | `API_GetGameInfoAndUserProgress` (`g=&a=1`) | Achievement definitions, unlock dates, game stats |
  | `API_GetUserAwards` | Awards wall |
  | `API_GetUserRecentlyPlayedGames` (`c=50`) | The "recent" set for the badge scope |
  | `API_GetAchievementsEarnedBetween` (`f=&t=`) | Latest 100 unlocks during sync; points in the last 7/30 days and the first hardcore unlock on demand (profile "See more" and 30-day chart); capped at 500 rows |

- **Media**: `https://media.retroachievements.org/Badge/<BadgeName>.png` and `_lock.png`,
  `https://media.retroachievements.org<ImageIcon>`, and
  `https://media.retroachievements.org/UserPic/<User>.png`.
- **Transport**:
  - `http.client.HTTPSConnection` kept open per host (API, media) with
    `ssl.create_default_context(cafile=$SSL_CERT_FILE)`. Measured on the Mini: the first
    request on a new connection takes 0.7–1 s (DNS and a TLS handshake on a Cortex-A7), later
    ones on the same connection about 0.1 s (about 7× faster), so connections are reused. With
    that, HTTPS is fast enough on the Mini.
  - On TLS errors (certificate dates, verification, protocol failures, or an unreadable CA
    bundle), retry over `http.client.HTTPConnection`. Only the fixed API and media hosts may
    fall back. Remember HTTP per host for that transport's lifetime; a new transport tries
    HTTPS again. DNS failures, timeouts, dropped sockets and HTTP statuses never cause a
    downgrade. No redirects are followed. The reachability HEAD uses this transport too.
  - The API host's `Date` updates the shared app clock (`core/clock.py`); media dates are ignored
    because CDN responses may be cached. The device clock and Spruce settings stay unchanged.
  - Timeouts: 10 s connect/read for the API, 20 s for media.
  - User-Agent: `Cheevos/<version> (SpruceOS <spruce version>; <PLATFORM>)`.
- **Rate limit**: RA limits requests per API key but publishes no numbers; its API docs only
  say rate limiting is enabled. Measured on 2026-10-06 with a 2,937-game account:
  - at ~2.6 requests/s (the old 0.3 s spacing), HTTP 429 within 7 s (`Retry-After: 1`), then
    one about every 5 s, and after about 9 of those `Retry-After: 600`;
  - at 1 request/s, none in 20 minutes (1,154 game details);
  - per key, not per IP: a keyless request from the same network still got a normal 401;
  - images: 5,101 downloads at ~20/s drew none.
- **Politeness**:
  - API calls share one `Pacer` (`ra_client/pacer.py`) across the whole app: the sync, the
    game worker, "See more" and the key check. It's a token bucket: after an idle spell, up to
    3 requests 1 s apart, then one every 3 s for extra headroom beyond the measured clean
    1 request/s. A sync with nothing new (4 requests) stays quick. No burst after a 429 pause.
  - Images use a separate pacer per client, with no burst and 0.25 s between starts. The sync
    downloads them itself, stored in batches of 25 per transaction; images needed while
    browsing come from one background worker. Disabling API pacing (`Pacer(0)` or a private
    client's `min_interval=0`) disables media pacing too, so unit tests and the desktop
    runner's recorded fixtures never wait for normal request slots.
  - HTTP 429 with a `Retry-After` of up to 10 s pauses every client, then retries (3 tries;
    exponential backoff without the header). A longer one fails at once with
    `RateLimitedError`: the sync stops, stores the time in `meta.rate_limited_until` and
    doesn't ask RA again before it ([sync-and-storage.md](sync-and-storage.md)).
  - 5xx retries with exponential backoff (3 tries).
  - Waits for a slot or a retry can be interrupted: Cancel and exit act at once.
- **Errors** map to typed exceptions: `AuthError`, `RateLimitedError`, `NetworkError`,
  `ApiPayloadError`, and `RequestCancelledError` for a cancelled wait.
- Responses are parsed into dataclasses at the client boundary. No raw dicts leak past
  `ra_client`.
- `FixtureTransport` replays recorded JSON for tests and for the desktop runner's fixture mode.

## API gotchas
- **Two date formats:** `"2026-08-22T11:42:13+00:00"` and `"2026-08-21 17:02:50"`, both UTC.
- **Completion progress is incomplete:** `API_GetUserCompletionProgress` omits games played
  without any unlock. Merge in `API_GetUserRecentlyPlayedGames`.
- **Pseudo-achievement 101000001:** RA's "unsupported emulator/core" warning. RetroArch even
  saves a `-cheevo-101000001.png` for it. Ignore it everywhere.
- **Unauthenticated calls:** answered with 401 and
  `{"message":"Unauthenticated.","errors":[...]}`.
- **Sizes:** badges are ~3 KB, avatars ~7 KB, a game's details 30–55 KB.
- **The summary needs `g>=1`** to include `LastGame` (title, console, icon). Its `LastActivity`
  is always an empty stub and `Status` always "Offline"; `RichPresenceMsgDate` is the closest
  thing to a last-activity time. `Rank` is null below 250 hardcore points.
- **`API_GetAchievementsEarnedBetween`** returns at most 500 rows, oldest first: page on from
  the last row's `Date` (`RaClient.unlocks_between`) for profile statistics. For Recent unlocks,
  search backwards in disjoint date windows and narrow every capped response before using
  it (`ra_client/recent.py`): reversing a capped response would miss the newest unlocks.
  Bounds come from RA's member/latest-unlock dates, not system time. The feed keeps one
  row per achievement at its newest returned event date and mode; it does not fabricate
  rarity from the endpoint's missing player statistics.
- **Awards:** `VisibleUserAwards` leaves out awards the player hid on the site, but the counts
  include them. `DisplayOrder` is the player's own arrangement. A mastered game usually holds a
  Beaten award too.
- **No spoiler flag:** achievements carry only type tags (progression, win_condition, missable),
  set by developers since 2023; many older sets have none.
- **Not available through the Web API** (so not shown): casual rank, real last activity, role
  badges, forum stats, time-to-beat.

## Following the website
**Visual language** (from RAWeb's `PlayerGameProgressBar`, `AwardIndicator`,
`buildAwardLabelColorClassNames`):
- hardcore progress amber→gold, casual-only `neutral-500`;
- award dots gold (mastery family) or silver (beaten family), filled = hardcore, hollow = casual;
  RA draws them as CSS circles, not images;
- mastered game icons get a 2 px gold border (`goldimage`);
- light mode swaps gold for `yellow-600`.

`ui/pyui/bar_colors.py` mirrors this and judges a row's background from the theme's background
and highlight images (averaged once). Where the contrast is too low, it falls back to the theme's
text colour in three strengths; award indicators use contrasting black or white.

**Profile numbers** (`core/stats.py`), after RAWeb's rules:
- subsets (recognised by "[Subset" in the title) and test kits never count as games;
- averages only consider sets of 6+ achievements and never Hubs or Events (consoles 100/101);
- "retail" leaves out tagged titles (~Demo~, ~Hack~, …) and homebrew consoles (71, 72, 80);
- casual-heavy players count casual unlocks in the recent points.

## Secrets
- The API key is plaintext on the SD card (`Saves/cheevos/apikey.txt`), like Spruce's RA
  password.
- Never log or format the key or full API URLs. `redact.py` wraps the logging record factory,
  so every record (ours and PyUI's) has `y=<...>` query values and the key itself masked: the
  message, the traceback and the stack. The key is registered as soon as it's known: when
  `credentials.py` reads or saves it, and when a client is created. Tests assert the key never
  appears in captured logs.
- **Typing the key:** PyUI logs any text it fails to draw (SDL errors happen when memory runs
  low), and a key being typed isn't registered yet. `ask_text(..., secret=True)` mutes PyUI's
  log while the keyboard is open.
- Players send their log (`Saves/spruce/cheevos-<device>.log`) with bug reports, so keep
  personal data out of it too. Today it holds no username or key; game titles appear in file
  paths.
- `scripts/record_fixtures.py` strips `y=` before saving; the key never reaches fixtures.
- Prefer verified HTTPS. If TLS fails, HTTP is an automatic compatibility fallback, explicitly
  requested for devices with unset or incorrect clocks. It sends the Web API key and account
  data unencrypted; this tradeoff is documented in the wiki's Setup page. Never disable
  certificate verification on an HTTPS connection.
