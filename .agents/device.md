# Devices: platform, packaging and tooling

The safety rules for working on a real device are in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) ("Devices") and
always apply. The device commands are in [TESTING.md](../TESTING.md).

## Target platform

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| OS | SpruceOS ≥ 4.5.0. Needs PyUI views, `spruce/scripts/appEnv.sh` and RAOfflineProxy 2.x. |
| Devices | Every device Spruce supports. Verified on a Miyoo Mini+ (640×480); the rest of the Mini family shares its setup. Others are untested. |
| Resolutions | Every resolution the default SPRUCE theme ships: 640×480, 720×480, 752×560, 720×720, 960×720, 1024×768, 1280×720, 480×800. |
| Runtime | Spruce's CPython **3.10.18**: `$SPRUCE_PYTHON` (32-bit: `spruce/bin/python/bin/python3.10`; 64-bit: `spruce/flip/bin/python3.10`). |
| Built-in modules we rely on | `ssl` (OpenSSL 3.5), `sqlite3`, `json`, `hashlib`, `zlib`, `ctypes`, `zoneinfo` |
| Third-party | **None of our own.** PySDL2 0.9.17 is loaded only indirectly, through PyUI. No `requests`, no Pillow. |
| UI toolkit | PyUI, imported at runtime from `/mnt/SDCARD/App/PyUI/main-ui` ([pyui.md](pyui.md)). |
| TLS | CA bundle at `$SSL_CERT_FILE` (`/mnt/SDCARD/spruce/etc/ca-certificates.crt`). An unset/incorrect clock or another TLS failure uses HTTP automatically. RA's Date supplies app time without changing the device clock. |

## Packaging

```
/mnt/SDCARD/App/Cheevos/
  config.json     {"label": "Cheevos", "icon": "cheevos.png", "launch": "launch.sh",
                   "description": "RetroAchievements hub"}   (no "devices": every device)
  launch.sh       sources helperFunctions.sh, sets the per-platform SDL env (mirroring PyUI's
                  launcher), runs Spruce's Python with -m cheevos; stderr to /tmp
  cheevos.png     app icon
  cheevos/        the Python package, with res/icons
  cache/          created at runtime
```

- `make package` builds it into `dist/App/Cheevos/` (no desktop shim, no tests) and zips that
  as `dist/Cheevos-<version>.zip`, with the `Cheevos/` prefix and no `App/` folder.
- The Apps launcher discovers any `App/*/config.json`. PyUI exits fully while the app runs and
  restarts when it quits.
- **No `devices` list:** a `devices` list in an app's `config.json` hides it on every device not
  named there. Cheevos ships without one, so the Apps menu shows it on every device.
  `launch.sh` covers every platform PyUI's launcher does.
- **Untested devices run the same code as the Mini.** Keep device-specific screens and code
  paths out of the app: we can't test them, so on exactly the devices they're for they would
  be the riskiest code. A one-time "untested device" note was removed for this reason (it also
  gave users nothing to act on). Release notes say which devices are tested.
- **Start-up failures:** when the app exits non-zero, `launch.sh` appends its stderr to the app
  log and shows a message ([product.md](product.md), "Offline and error behaviour").
  `/mnt/SDCARD/App/PyUI/launch.sh -msgDisplay "text" -msgDisplayTimeMs 5000` shows a message on
  any platform.
- The release is that zip; users copy its `Cheevos` folder into `App` on the SD card. Pushing a
  `v<version>` tag publishes it as a GitHub release (the `release` job in `ci.yml`; steps in
  [RELEASING.md](../RELEASING.md), under "Releases"). The description links merged PR titles
  and direct commit titles.
  Pre-releases start at the previous version tag; stable releases start at the previous stable tag.
  Game Nursery packaging follows whatever format the maintainers ask for.

## Device gotchas (verified on a Miyoo Mini+, SpruceOS 4.5.0)
- **Idle check:** a test once replaced the cache under an open session; hence the rule to check
  that neither Cheevos nor a game is running first.
- **Stray taps:** once Cheevos exits (B on its home screen), further taps reach Spruce's menu,
  where A starts a game. A blind tap loop once launched a game this way. `device.sh press` now
  refuses on the device unless Cheevos is running, and stops at the first refusal. Still,
  take a screenshot between screens rather than sending long sequences.
- **`pgrep -f` self-match:** a plain `pgrep -f` pattern also matches the remote shell's own
  command line. Use the `[x]` trick (`'[c]heevos'`).
- **busybox limits:** busybox tar rejects pax/xattr headers, so deploy uses
  `COPYFILE_DISABLE=1 tar --format ustar`. Busybox `sort` has no `-h`.
- **SSH:** ssh's ControlPath must be under ~104 bytes, so the control socket lives in
  `/tmp/cheevos-mini-%C`.
- **Screenshots:** `fbgrab` output is upside down; rotate it 180° (Spruce's `screenshot.sh`
  does the same).
- **Input injection:** `send_event /dev/input/event0 CODE:1|0`. Codes: A=57, B=29, X=42,
  Y=56, Start=28, Select=97, L1=18, R1=20, D-pad 103/108/105/106. Never send MENU (1), power
  or combos.
- **Launching an app remotely:** write `/tmp/cmd_to_run.sh` (PyUI's own format), then send
  SIGTERM to PyUI; `principal.sh` runs the command and restarts PyUI afterwards. This also
  records autoresume, exactly as launching from the Apps menu does.
- **Graphics memory:** SDL textures come from the MMA pool (`mma_heap=…sz=0x1500000`, 21 MB),
  not from the RAM `MemAvailable` reports. The framebuffer and PyUI's screen-sized canvases
  take about 11.5 MB of it, leaving about 9 MB for textures. Free space:
  `/proc/mi_modules/mi_sys_mma/mma_heap_name0` (`chunk_mgr_avail`, hex). Big textures need
  one contiguous block. See [pyui.md](pyui.md), "Texture caches never evict".
- **Log times are UTC** (marked `Z`): PyUI applies the saved time zone partway through
  start-up, so local times would jump within one run.
- **PIDs wrap at 4096**, so a low PID doesn't mean an old process. Check
  `/proc/<pid>/stat` against `/proc/uptime` for its age.
- **Network services:** Spruce restarts Samba and SFTPGo after every app exits; SSH (dropbear)
  survives.
- **Storage, `/tmp` and the clock:** see [sync-and-storage.md](sync-and-storage.md).
- **What the desktop can't show:** the MMIYOO SDL driver's quirks (translucent fills, see
  [pyui.md](pyui.md)), real speed, FAT32, the real proxy, Wi-Fi and an unset clock.

## Performance (Miyoo Mini+)

The hardware: a Cortex-A7 at 1.2 GHz, 128 MB RAM, slow SD writes. Big lists and image-heavy
screens need a check on it.
